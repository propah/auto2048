# auto2048
Copy of 2048 but auto
This is a project for school, it doesn't need to be perfect.<br/>
This project is far from being finished and optimised. (The functions to move the tiles are horrible)<br/>
The IA part is not done yet but will be soon (not a true IA, but something more inteligent than a random algorithm)<br/>
You can change the size of the board in the Main.cpp file when the run function is called.<br/>
There are not much comment yet but I will work on that soon.<br/>
