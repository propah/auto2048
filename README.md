# auto2048
Copy of 2048 but auto
This is for a school project.
This project is far from being finished and optimised. (The functions to move the tiles are horrible)
The IA part is not done yet but will be soon (not a true IA, but something more inteligent than a random algorithm)
You can change the size of the board in the Main.cpp file when the run function is called.
There are not much comment yet but I will work on that soon.
